# Plurality-Majority Paradox

We say that there is a Plurality-Majority paradox if there is a candidate that is preferred in more than half of the votes over the candidate who won at the elections. Plurality means the candidate gained more votes than any other candidate, but not half of the votes. The majority, a strict one, means that the candidate gained more than half of the votes. 

This notebook provides an analysis of whether the Plurality-Majority paradox exists in the given elections. The first step is to find out which candidate is elected by the Plurality rule. The second step is to determine if there is some candidate with strict majority votes over the winner, within the rankings. The data from the [PrefLib website](https://www.preflib.org/) was analyzed and the PM paradox frequency was 32% for .soi datasets and 10% for .soc datasets.
